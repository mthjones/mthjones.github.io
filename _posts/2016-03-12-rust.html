# Why Rust?

#### or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Borrow Checker

---

# About Rust

* Current stable release: 1.7.0
--

* Consistent 6-week release cycle
--

* High-level low-level language
--

* All the high-level language constructs you'd expect in Python...
--

* With all the low-level speed and hardware accessibility you'd expect in C

---

# About Rust

* Fast. <a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/rust.html" target="_blank">Really fast!</a>
--

* Safe. Really safe!<sup>*</sup>

<small>*: there are ways to break safety for things that require it, like direct hardware access</small>

???

More on how it accomplishes these in a sec.

# About Rust

## Who's using it?

### Companies
* Mozilla
* Dropbox
* Skylight.io
* OpenDNS

### Big projects
* Redox OS
* Piston game engine
* [lots more...](https://github.com/kud1ing/awesome-rust)

???

* Mozilla is using it to develop Servo, an experimental browser that is influencing Firefox development
  * there is also now some Rust code in the latest versions of Firefox!
  * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0hYIRQRiws" target="_blank">Servo rendering example</a>
* Dropbox is using it as a new storage engine for their exabyte+ block storage system
* Skylight.io is a Ruby on Rails performance tracker
* Redox OS is an ambitious project to build an entirely new OS using Rust

---

# How Rust is Fast

* No garbage collection!

* With garbage collection, you'll often see CPU spikes when it cleans which can cause a significant performance drop

count: false

# How Rust is Fast

* No garbage collection!
  * of course, that has its drawbacks
  * the compiler needs to know exactly how long all objects live for so that it can clean them up at the appropriate times
--


* Enter lifetimes!
  * **all** references are assigned lifetimes that look like: `'a`
  * most of the time these lifetimes are automatically determined by the compiler and don't need to be specified
  * there is one special lifetime: `'static`
    * it means that the object lives for the entire duration of the program

---

# How Rust is Fast

* Zero-cost abstractions

> What you don’t use, you don’t pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.

# Why & How of Safety

* Two important terms to know:
--

  * Aliasing: when there are multiple references to the same object in memory
--

  * Mutation: when an object in memory is able to be modified
--

* Rust allows a reference to be aliased XOR mutable
--

Example:

```rust
let mut obj = "hello world!";
let x = &obj;
let y = &obj;
let z = &mut obj;  // ERROR - can't take mutable reference to an object that is immutably borrowed
```

???

* I'll let Alex Chrichton, one of the Rust developers, explain why this is important.

---

# Why & How of Safety

* The borrow checker also entirely prevents multithreading data races as well
--

* Let's walk through an example of getting multiple threads to simultaneously read and write a vector:
  * <a href="http://is.gd/DuvwZf" target="_blank">Rust Playground</a>

???

Start:
* *explain syntax if necessary*
* Error: need to move ownership of `v` into closure

After move:
* Error: `v` needs to be used by both the main thread and the child threads
* Try using Rc to share a reference to the object
* `use std::rc::Rc`, `Rc::new`, `let v = v.clone()` (inside for)

After Rc:
* Oops, Rc isn't safe to send across thread boundaries
* Arc to the rescue!
* replace Rc with Arc

After Arc:
* Can't borrow object immutable as mutable (Arc only has an immutable reference to the object internally)
* We need thread-safe mutability!
* Mutexes!
* `let v = &mut *v.lock().unwrap();`

End goal: http://is.gd/oN7qS9

# Rust from a C# Perspective

* `null` is a part of the type system
  * no more unexpected `NullReferenceException`
  * `Option<T>` instead

--

* Exceptions are a part of the type system
  * no longer necessary to read documentation to know if a function can error
  * `Result<T, E>` instead
  * can still `panic`, but these are for true *abort* scenarios, not control flow

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

* Still (can be) object-oriented, but with a slightly different flavour
  * strict separation of data (`struct`) and behaviour (`impl`)
  * `struct`s can not inherit from each other, unlike `class`es

--

* `interface` &rarr; `trait`
  * think "X can Y" instead of "X is a Y" though
  * traits can have default fn implementations
  * allows extending existing `struct`s with new `trait`s, like extension methods

--

* `namespace` &rarr; `mod`
  * modules can have "free" functions, unlike namespaces

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

* `match` is like `switch` on steroids
* `enum`s share the same name, but have several differences
  * Rust's can be similar to C#'s
  * ...but they can also be much more powerful

```rust
pub enum Input {
  Keyboard(Key),
  Mouse { left: bool, right: bool, middle: bool }
}

pub fn handle(input: Input) {
  match input {
    Keyboard(k) => { move_character(k); },
    Mouse { left: true, .. } => { attack(); },
    _ => {}
  };
}
```

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### C# OOP example

```csharp
public interface IShape {
  double Area { get; }
}

public class Circle: IShape {
  private double Radius;

  public double Area {
    get {
      return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### Rust OOP example

```rust
pub trait HasArea {
  fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

pub struct Circle {
  radius: f64;
}

impl HasArea for Circle {
  fn area(&self) -> f64 {
    f64::consts::PI * (self.radius * self.radius)
  }
}
```

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### C# Exception Handling Example

```csharp
public int GetNumber() {
  // ...
}
```

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(GetNumber());
```

???

* Can this function fail? How can we know?
* If only it had some documentation to read...

---
count: false

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### C# Exception Handling Example

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets a number or randomly fails. Good luck!
/// </summary>
/// <exception cref="RngException">Thrown when the odds aren't in your favor.</exception>
public int GetNumber() {
  // ...
}
```

```csharp
try {
  Console.WriteLine(GetNumber());
} catch(RngException e) {
  Console.WriteLine("Failed to get number. Error: {0}", e);
}
```

???

* Oh there's documentation now! So we'll just catch RngException and we're all set!

---
count: false

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### C# Exception Handling Example

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets a number or randomly fails. Good luck!
/// </summary>
/// <exception cref="RngException">Thrown when the odds aren't in your favor.</exception>
public int GetNumber() {
  if (rng.Next() < 0.5) {
    throw new ShinyNewException("unlucky");
  }

  return 4;
}
```

```csharp
try {
  Console.WriteLine(GetNumber());
} catch(RngException e) {
  Console.WriteLine("Failed to get number. Error: {0}", e);
}
// boom
```

???

* Good thing documentation never goes out of date, right?

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### Rust Exception Handling Example

```rust
pub fn get_number() -> Result<i32, RngError> {
  if rng.next() < 0.5 {
    return Err(RngError("unlucky".to_owned()));
  }

  Ok(4)
}
```

```rust
match get_number() {
  Ok(n) => println!("{}", n),
  Err(m) => println!("Failed to get number. Error: {}", m),
};
```

???

How about having the code be self-documenting instead?

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### C# Parameter Checking

```csharp
public string Palindromize(string s) {
  if (s == null) {
    throw new ArgumentNullException("...");
  }

  var reversed = string.Join( "", s.Reverse() );
  return s + reversed;
}
```

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### Rust Parameter Checking

```rust
pub fn palindromize(s: String) -> String {
  let reversed = s.chars().rev().collect::<String>();
  s + &reversed
}
```

???

Nothing to check! We know that s has a value because the compiler enforces it!

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### C# Parameter Checking (optional)

```csharp
public void SayHello(string name) {
  if (name == null) {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello!");
  }

  Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### Rust Parameter Checking (optional)

```rust
pub fn say_hello(name: Option<String>) {
  match name {
    None => println!("Hello!"),
    Some(n) => println!("Hello, {}!", name)
  };
}
```

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### C# Extension Methods

```csharp
using AnotherLib.Circle;

public static class CircleExtensions {
  public static void Scale(this Circle circle, double factor) {
    circle.Radius *= factor;
  }
}
```

---

# Rust from a C# Perspective

### Rust Trait Extending

```rust
use another_lib::Circle;

pub trait Scalable {
  fn scale(&mut self, factor: f64);
}

impl Scalable for Circle {
  fn scale(&mut self, factor: f64) {
    self.radius *= factor;
  }
}
```
